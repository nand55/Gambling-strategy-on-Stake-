# Gambling-strategy-on-Stake-
A Stake is a online betting platform which offers a variety of casino games like 'Russian roulette " , "Black jack", "Baccarat"  etc  and sports betting . This project is about picking a particular game and  try to develop a strategy to hack the game and to win big amount of money.

- In this , I picked a virtual game called "dice" , which allows to bet a amount and dice is rolled, if number is above 50 , it's win or loss otherwise.
  The strategy used in this to crack the game is " Martingale theory " on gambling and betting , which explains to doubling-down system used to recover losses by betting bigger after every loss.

ðŸ“‹ Core Idea:
You double your bet after every loss, so when you eventually win, you recover all previous losses plus make a profit equal to your original bet as long as one has enough liqudity/ funds .
Using the API of stake platform , that sends out the REQUEST to GraphQL server and writing a code of this strategy , it is possible to place automatic bets with certain amount 
as a threshold value .

~ Conclusion : This proved an effictive strategy for short term betting and to small win amounts , but in long term process , it is difficult to win against house and resulted in loss
